"""
Shared pytest fixtures for tests that need a real Postgres database.

These tests run inside the `web` Docker container via `make test-db`,
where `db:5432` resolves to the unifleet-db container started by
`docker-compose.yml`.

The `postgres_db` fixture creates a unique `unifleet_test_<uuid>` database
once per test session, yields a DSN pointing to it, and drops the database
on teardown. Tests must use this fixture (or the `postgres_db`-derived DSN)
to get a clean schema per session.

The `schema_db` fixture additionally applies `db/schema.sql` to that
fresh database once per session, so the full F2.1 schema is in place
for the T2/T3 tests.

Override the admin DSN with the `TEST_DATABASE_ADMIN_DSN` env var if needed
(e.g., to point at a different maintenance DB). The admin DSN must point
to a database that already exists (typically `postgres` or `unifleet`),
not the test database itself, because we use it to issue CREATE/DROP DATABASE.

# main.py starts the notifications outbox worker at import time. In a test
# process that thread is a second, uninvited drainer: several tests
# monkeypatch notifications.mailer module-wide and point the process-wide
# pool at the ephemeral test database, at which point the worker happily
# claims the very rows a test is about to drain. That produced an
# intermittent failure in the retry-ladder tests.
#
# This used to be done by forcing NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false, but that flag
# now also gates enqueues (ARCH A12), so switching it off would stop the
# suite writing any notification rows at all. Instead the suite runs at the
# production default and simply claims the worker slot before main.py can:
# start_worker() is idempotent, so finding the handle already set makes it a
# no-op. Tests that exercise start_worker itself reset the handle first.

# race this file exists to prevent.
